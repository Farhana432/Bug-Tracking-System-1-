                    A bug tracking system or defect tracking system is a software application that keeps track of reported software bugs in software development projects. It may be regarded as a type of issue tracking system.Large systems may have hundreds or thousands of defects. Each needs to be evaluated, monitored and prioritized for debugging. In some cases, bugs may need to be tracked over a long period of time.

                    “Defect tracking is an important process in software engineering, as complex and business critical systems have hundreds of defects,” says Tutorials Point. “One of the challenging factors is managing, evaluating and prioritizing these defects. The number of defects gets multiplied over a period of time and to effectively manage them, a defect tracking system is used to make the job easier."

                <h3>How bug tracking System works?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A software bug occurs when an application or program doesn’t work the way it is designed to function. Most errors are faults or mistakes made by system architects, designers or developers. Testing teams use bug tracking to monitor and report on errors that occur as an application is developed and tested.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    “A major component of a bug tracking system is a database that records facts about known bugs,” says Wikipedia. “Facts may include the time a bug was reported, its severity, the erroneous program behavior and details on how to reproduce the bug; as well as the identity of the person who reported it and any programmers who may be fixing it.”

                    During its lifetime, a single defect may go through several stages or states. They include:
                    <br>
                    -Active: Investigation is underway<br>
                    -Test: Fixed and ready for testing<br>
                    -Verified: Retested and verified by quality assurance (QA)<br>
                    -Closed: Can be closed after QA retesting or if it is not considered to be a defect<br>
                    -Reopened: Not fixed and reactivated 3<br>
                    -Bugs are managed based on priority and severity. Severity levels help to identify the relative impact of a problem on a product release. These classifications may vary in number, but they generally include some form of the following:
                    <br>
                    Catastrophic: Causes total failure of the software or unrecoverable data loss. There is no workaround and the product can’t be released.
                    Impaired functionality: A workaround may exist, but it is unsatisfactory. The software can’t be released.
                    Failure of non-critical systems: A reasonably satisfactory workaround exists. The product may be released, if the bug is documented.
                    Very minor: There is a workaround, or the issue can be ignored. It does not impact a product release.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Why bug tracking is important</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    It is estimated that software developers make 100 to 150 errors for every thousand lines of code.4  According to a report by the Consortium for IT Software Quality (CISQ): “Even if only a small fraction — say 10 percent — of these errors are serious, then a relatively small application of 20,000 lines of code will have roughly 200 serious coding errors." 
                  </p>
                <p>Software testing is essential for isolating and mitigating errors. A good QA process can uncover hundreds or even thousands of defects, and testing teams need to manage all of them. Integrating bug tracking into the testing workflow improves efficiency by helping testers prioritize, monitor and report on the status of each error.
